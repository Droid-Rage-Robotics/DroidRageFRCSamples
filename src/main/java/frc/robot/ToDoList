ToDo:
    Limelight Tracking
        Change Shooter targetVelocity
        Align Drivetrain
        auto align-Make a button that automatically aligns to 180 degrees with a press of a button; only when held - still leave control of drive to driver except for turning
    Add subsystems
        Telescoping Arm
        Shooter Hood
        Pneumatics
    Robot Tracking on Field
    Battery Usage Tracking
        Logging Battery usage
    Test Advantage Kit
        Logging Robot Positioning
    override button for when sensors fail
    custom shuffleboard droid rage theme
    ---------------------------------Field Centric Turning
    Lights
        Add lights to have the robot tell us any errors with can, etc; Make LEDs show Errors
    Extension automatically commit any code when pushing code to bot (added it) - need to see if it works
    BatteryTracker with QR code (make or use Mechanical Advantage one) - Logging Battery usage
    SubsystemCheck Command
    Add 6 Wheel?
    Add Swerve Drive
    Make all of the writes that are not necessary during a match be in a practice only writers (Helps prevent the likelihood of loop overruns)
    Use DutyCycleEncoder for the Through Bore Encoder to use? 
        public boolean isThroughBoreConnected() {
            return absoluteEncoder.isConnected();
        }
    Add Timeout for Button Triggers?
    

Test:
- Test CycleTracker: https://github.com/3015RangerRobotics/2023Public/blob/main/RobotCode2023/src/main/java/frc/lib/util/CycleTracker.java#L6
- Make all of the writes that are not necessary during a match be in a practice only writers (Helps prevent the likelyhood of loop overruns); Some way to Stop some Values from being updated on the driver station
- 

Done:
